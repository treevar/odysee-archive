## Authors

I have made a [file](authors/authors.csv) of a large majority of FOSS CAD related channels in an effort to consolidate the current lists and make it easy to access. It is also in the CSV format to make it useful in automating things, as well as organizing the data in a widely supported format.

### Plan:

- Add `Tags` field that contains standardized tags that describe what content is on the channel
- Add `Notable Creations` field that contains custom text, that's used for finding popular posts
- Continue to add channels

### Running:
There is a [script](authors/index.js) used for adding channels to the list. You must run `npm install` in the directory with the script before you can use it.

### Contributing:

**Know of a channel that isn't on the list?** <br>
&emsp;Let me know by either making an issue on here <br>
&emsp;or by sending me an email at fosscadlist[at]lfod.top<br>
&emsp;*include either the odysee/lbry url or id*
